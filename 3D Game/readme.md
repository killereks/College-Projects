#3D Game: Wolfenstein Inspired
Welcome to our 3D game inspired by the classic Wolfenstein engine, featuring raycasting as the main rendering engine. This game includes several features to enhance your experience, including textures that correctly tile, performance FPS graphs, a minimap, and a fake 3D rotation system for the player, including jumping.

The game is divided into several HTML files, each with its own unique features.

- game2.html contains the main game, with textures that correctly tile and a performance FPS graph to help you monitor your game's performance. The minimap allows you to easily navigate the game world, and the fake 3D rotation system for the player provides a more immersive experience.

- game3.html contains a working gun and a fancy reload animation, allowing you to take down enemies in style.

- game4.html has an optimized raycasting technique, tripling the fps. This allows you to enjoy the game with smoother performance and improved graphics.

- game5.html has no weapon and improved graphics, allowing you to focus on exploring the game world and immersing yourself in the experience.
