#2D RPG Idle Game
Welcome to our 2D RPG idle game, built with a custom engine in JavaScript. This game features a variety of elements to keep you entertained, including physics, NPC conversations, RPG elements, a skill tree, camera frustum culling, a quest system, and a building system.

The game's physics system allows for realistic interactions between characters and objects in the game world. The NPC conversation system adds depth to the game by allowing players to interact with non-player characters and learn more about the game's story and characters. The RPG elements, such as the skill tree, give players the ability to customize their character and playstyle.

The camera frustum culling optimizes the game's performance by only rendering objects that are currently visible on the screen. The quest system provides players with goals to work towards and a sense of progression through the game. Finally, the building system allows players to construct and upgrade structures, adding another layer of depth to the gameplay.

We hope you enjoy playing our 2D RPG idle game!
